# Debugging Attempt Logs

## Objective:
Document and track unsuccessful attempts to save issue analysis markdown files.

### Repeated Issues:
1. High-priority issues:
    - `convertToDto_error_handling_issue.md`
    - `inconsistent_field_validations_issue.md`
2. Medium-priority issues:
    - `skipping_dto_conversion_with_empty_ids_issue.md`
    - `ambiguous_defaults_in_convertFromDto_issue.md`

### Technical Observations:
- All save attempts return `None` as their output.
- Directory paths: "/workspaces/terraform-provider-power-platform/.magentic-one/find_all_issues/issues_found"

### Hypotheses:
#### Root Causes Could Include:
   - Directory permissions might be restricted.
   - Tool misconfiguration.
   - Potential false positive or timeout unexamined. Debug technical trails

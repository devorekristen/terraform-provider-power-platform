The `ExecuteApiRequest` function in `api_rest.go` has two issues related to error handling and code structure:

1. **Use of `panic` in Error Scenarios**:
   - The function calls `panic` when the `scope` parameter is `nil`. This is not ideal since `panic` should be reserved for truly unrecoverable errors or programmer mistakes. Instead, it is more appropriate to return an error to allow the caller to handle the situation gracefully.

   ```go
   if scope != nil {
       return client.Api.Execute(ctx, []string{*scope}, method, url, h, body, expectedStatusCodes, nil)
   }
   panic("scope or environment_id must be provided")
   ```

   - Suggested Improvement: Replace the `panic` call with proper error handling, such as:

     ```go
     if scope == nil {
         return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid input: scope or environment_id must be provided")
     }
     ```

2. **Error Branching and Fall-Through Logic**:
   - The current function structure places the success case inside a conditional block (`if scope != nil`), while the error case (`panic(...)`) is outside it. This structure can be improved by handling the error case first and allowing the success case to "fall through," which is a more idiomatic approach in Go.

   - Suggested Improvement: Refactor the function to handle errors first and move the success case to the fall-through path:

     ```go
     func (client *client) ExecuteApiRequest(ctx context.Context, scope *string, url, method string, body *string, headers map[string]string, expectedStatusCodes []int) (*api.Response, error) {
         h := http.Header{}
         for k, v := range headers {
             h.Add(k, v)
         }

         if scope == nil {
             return nil, fmt.Errorf("invalid input: scope or environment_id must be provided")
         }

         return client.Api.Execute(ctx, []string{*scope}, method, url, h, body, expectedStatusCodes, nil)
     }
     ```

#### Expected Behavior

- The function should not use `panic` for routine error handling.
- The function should handle errors first and let the success path fall through for better readability and maintainability.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Call the `ExecuteApiRequest` function with a `nil` value for the `scope` parameter.
2. Observe that the program panics with the message: `"scope or environment_id must be provided"`.

#### Suggested Fix

Implement the improvements outlined above to:

- Replace the `panic` call with proper error handling.
- Refactor the function to handle errors first and allow the success case to fall through.

#### Additional Context

This improvement aligns with Go's best practices for error handling and improves the maintainability and robustness of the code.
